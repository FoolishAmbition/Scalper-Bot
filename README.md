# Scalper-Bot
This scalper bot was made at the request of my friend to buy Nvidia GPU 5090s founders edition. I utilised TypeScript, Python, and Javascript for the implementation of Playwright, Puppeteer, and/or selenium. 
**#update#** unable to secure a piece, due to limited quantity sold (100p), paper launch. but happy to learn new things everyday! :)

Initially set as private as I'm not proud to have made a scalper bot, but will be making others and this one public in the future, for University Applications.
